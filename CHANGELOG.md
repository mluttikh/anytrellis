# Changelog

All notable changes to anytrellis. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (before 1.0, minor versions may change the API).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation at [mluttikh.github.io/anytrellis](https://mluttikh.github.io/anytrellis/):
  tutorials, how-to guides, a gallery, the API reference and explanations, with live plots.

### Changed

- A page of many plots (`standalone.js`) starts each plot as it scrolls near, so a long
  page stays within the browser's limit of GPU contexts.

### Fixed

- Box plots failed in WebAssembly (marimo's in-browser notebooks, Pyodide), where indices
  are 32-bit.
- A plot now redraws when the page switches between light and dark by
  `data-md-color-scheme` (Material and Zensical sites).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-07

The first release.

### Added

- `Trellis`: one panel per level of the facet columns: a wrap (`wrap=`, `cols=`) or a
  grid (`row=`, `col=`) that keeps empty cells, with shared, per-row, per-column or free
  scales (`share_x=`, `share_y=`), linear or log (`x_scale=`, `y_scale=`).
- Marks: `line`, `points`, `bars` (stacked or dodged), `area`, `band`, `rect`, `text`,
  `rule`, and summaries computed per panel in Python: `hist`, `box`, `density` and `smooth`
  (loess or linear, with a confidence band).
- Data from Polars, pandas, PyArrow or DuckDB (through narwhals), or a dict of arrays;
  numbers, times and categories, with category colours and legends.
- Drawing with WebGPU, WebGL2 or Canvas 2D, whichever the browser has; the data goes to the
  browser once, as binary buffers, so millions of marks stay interactive.
- Zooming and panning (scroll, drag, one axis, box zoom), panels that share a scale
  zooming together, `fit_y` to fit y to the data in view, undo and reset; one panel at a
  time (`open`, `close`) and full screen.
- Selecting: a brush (`s`) in every panel or, with `link=`, in one panel and followed by
  key; `select()`, `selection` and `selected()` from Python. Clicking legend entries
  selects their colours.
- Linked plots: `link(a, b, ..., on=)` shares one selection between plots, histograms
  filling to their selected share (crossfiltering).
- Tooltips with Python's values; `save_html` writes a page that opens without Python.
- Works in JupyterLab and marimo, and other anywidget hosts (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code).
- `anytrellis.datasets.load`: six small example datasets, with their sources and licences
  in `datasets/SOURCES.md`; example notebooks for Jupyter and marimo.
